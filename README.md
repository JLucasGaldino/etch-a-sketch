# Project definition
This project consists of a simple html page with minimal css and about 50 lines of javascript. It contains a canvas in the middle which contains a grid divided into a certain number of squares. 

A button on top allows the user to generate a new grid with a different number of squares.

When a square is hovered over in the grid, it becomes colorful, creating a drawing.
